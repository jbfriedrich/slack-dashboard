# Slack Dashboard

A simple Slack Dashboard created with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and some JQuery/Javascript.

I wanted a simple web interface to quickly post [short informational messages](https://api.slack.com/docs/messages)(work in progress), set my Slack [status](https://api.slack.com/docs/presence-and-status#custom_status) and toggle my [user presence](https://api.slack.com/docs/presence-and-status#user_presence).
